<h2>6. Quantide Growth Partners Acquires Value Innorruption Advisors</h2>

<p><strong>Acquirer:</strong> Quantide Growth Partners (Private - formerly Fractional Pricing Advisors)<br>
<strong>Target:</strong> Value Innorruption Advisors LLC<br>
<strong>Announcement Time:</strong> 10:09 AM ET<br>
<strong>Press Release URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251208544554/en/Pricing-Solutions-Startup-Quantide-Growth-Partners-Acquires-Value-Innorruption-Advisors-LLC">https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251208544554/en/Pricing-Solutions-Startup-Quantide-Growth-Partners-Acquires-Value-Innorruption-Advisors-LLC</a></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The company formerly known as Fractional Pricing Advisors has rebranded itself to Quantide Growth Partners along with securing its first acquisition. Quantide Growth Partners founder and CEO Ethan Williams identified a gap in the market: small to medium-sized businesses often lack the budget and the access to the strategic pricing services their larger competitors rely on to drive profitable growth. He launched the startup to disrupt the pricing industry and to dominate the pricing advisory market for SMBs. The acquisition of Value Innorruption Advisors LLC strengthens Quantide's capabilities in pricing strategy and consulting services.</p>
